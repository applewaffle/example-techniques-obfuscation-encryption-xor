# XOR Example
XOR offers a simple but effective encryption technique

## How to XOR a string of text:
In order to understand how to use XOR to obfuscate parts of an executable we will first look at a simple example of how to effective XOR a string of text so that we will be able to appy this simple technique to the overall harder problem that we are trying to accomplish. I will show this example using different languages for easy experimentation later on

### Using Python
[XOR string](xor_string.py)
